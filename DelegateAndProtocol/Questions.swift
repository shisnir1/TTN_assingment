//MARK:- What is push notification?How it works?
/*
 Apple Push Notification service (APNs) is the centerpiece of the remote notifications feature. It is a robust, secure, and highly efficient service for app developers to propagate information to iOS (and, indirectly, watchOS), tvOS, and macOS devices.
 
 Things  you can do with APNs:
 ->Display a message
 ->Play a sound
 ->Set a badge icon on your app
 ->Provide actions the user can act upon with or without opening the app
 ->Show an image or other type of media
 ->Be silent but ask the app to perform some action in the background
